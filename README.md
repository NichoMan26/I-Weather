Hi! I have done the task. You can find my weather app https://objective-blackwell-5da15a.netlify.app/ (Netlify) or on myself host https://i-weather.basenkodenis.ru/ and also view the code here.

!!! I ran into the CORS problem and solved it with using of proxy server. That's why I kindly ask you before the view my app, click https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo for give access to your browser.

I did not use all my ideas when implementing the app due to time limit.  But I feel able to improve this one.

Hope to get feedback soon!
